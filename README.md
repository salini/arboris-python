About Arboris
=============

Arboris is a rigid body dynamics and contacts simulator written in python.

Arboris includes a generic and easily extensible set of joints
(singularity-free multi-dof joints, non-honolomic joints, etc.) which are
used to model open rigid mechanisms with a minimal set of state variables.

The dynamics of these systems are computed in a form similar to the
Boltzmann-Hamel equations.

Using time-stepping and a semi-implicit Euler integration scheme, a first-order
approximation of the model is also computed. This allows for additional
constraints such as contacts and kinematic loops to be solved using a
Gauss-Seidel algorithm.

Arboris is mostly useful for robotic applications and human motion studies.
The python language makes it particularly suited for fast-paced development
(prototyping) and education.


Background
==========

In 2005, Alain Micaelli, a researcher from CEA LIST, wrote a first version of
the simulator in the matlab language. It was an implementation (and often an
extension) of the algorithms described in [Park2005]_, [Murray1994]_ and
[Liu2003]_.
He was later joined by Sébastien Barthélemy, from ISIR/UPMC, who reorganized
the code to take advantage of the early object-oriented features of matlab.
It eventually became clear that the language was ill-designed, and that a full
rewrite was necessary. With the help of Joseph Salini, also from ISIR/UPMC,
Arboris-python was born. The resulting framework is now quite similar to what
is presented in [Duindam2006]_.

The matlab version of the simulator is now deprecated.
